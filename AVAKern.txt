Associated with FontForge bug #4668:
 https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4668

These are two sample Mac font suitcases:

* AVAKern.bin is a PostScript Type 1 font suitcase for a font family
named AVAKern, and AVAKerReg.bin, AVAKerIta.bin, AVAKerBol.bin and
AVAKerBolIta.bin are the associated outline files for its four styles
(Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic). The font suitcase contains,
among other data, kerning info for the associated outline files.

* AVAKernTT.bin is a TrueType font suitcase for a font family named
AVAKernTT. The font suitcase contains both the outlines of its four
styles (Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic), as well as kerning info
for each of them.

Particularly, both have very obvious negative kerning for the following
pairs in all four styles: AV, VA, av and va.

In order to open the outlines of the Type 1 version in FontForgeâ€™s GUI
and retain the kerning info, one needs to first open an outline file
and then go to menu File > Merge Feature Info > AVAKern.bin. No special
multistep process is needed in the case of the TrueType version.

The fonts were generated with FontLab 5 Studio Demo, which heavily
restricts the number of glyphs. Therefore, all four styles only have
characters A-C, S-X, all in the shape of upper case. The outlines were
copied from Source Sans (and then Fontlab watermarked some).

All six files were MacBin-encoded so that they survive in non-Mac
filesystems. AFAIK, FontForge can still transparently load them without
any intermediate decoding.
