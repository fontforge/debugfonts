Associated with FontForge bug #4668:
 https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4668

This is a sample Mac Type 1 font suitcase with its associated outline
files, for a font family named AVAKern with four styles: Regular,
Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. AVAKern.bin is the font suitcase itself.
AVAKerReg.bin, AVAKerIta.bin, AVAKerBol.bin and AVAKerBolIta.bin are
the associated outline files.

The font suitcase contains, among other data, kerning info for the
associated outline files. Particularly, it has very obvious negative
kerning for the following pairs in all four styles: AV, VA, av and va.

In order to open the outlines in FontForgeâ€™s GUI and retain the kerning
info, one needs to first open an outline file and then go to menu File
> Merge Feature Info > AVAKern.bin.

The fonts were generated with FontLab 5 Studio Demo, which heavily
restricts the number of glyphs. Therefore, all four styles only have
characters A-C, S-X, all in the shape of upper case. The outlines were
copied from Source Sans (and then Fontlab watermarked some).

All five files were MacBin-encoded so that they survive in non-Mac
filesystems. AFAIK, FontForge can still transparently load them without
any intermediate decoding.
